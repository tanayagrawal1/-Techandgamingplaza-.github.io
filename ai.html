                Hey hello friends I am back with a new post in which I am going to tell you about artificial intelligence.
                So our first question is that what is artificial intelligence-
                Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. ... It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines..
                Our next question is that it has how many types and what are these types
                There are 3 types of artificial intelligence
                 AI narrow or weak 
                AI general or strong 
                AI  artificial super intelligence
                What is AI general or strong
                Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the representation of generalized human cognitive abilities in software so that, faced with an unfamiliar task, the AI system could find a solution. ... IBM's Watson supercomputer, expert systems and the self-driving car are all examples of weak or narrow AI.
                What is AI narrow or weak
                Narrow AI is artificial intelligence applied to a single task such as a chatbot, virtual assistant or self-driving car. Also called "weak AI." Contrast with strong AI. See AGI. THIS DEFINITION IS FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY.
                What is AI artificial super intelligence
                It may be theoretically impossible for humans to control a super intelligent AI, a new study finds. Worse still, the research also quashes any hope for detecting such an unstoppable AI when it's on the verge of being created
